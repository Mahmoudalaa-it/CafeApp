# Automating Infrastructure Deployment For The CafeApp 

 I used AWS CloudFormation to deploy a static version of the café website .then deployed the dynamic café website as a web application.
For the dynamic website, I used a CI/CD pipeline that used AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodePipeline, and AWS CloudFormation. 
In addition, duplicated both the network resources and the café application resources to another AWS Region.


# Steps


1- Deployed a virtual private cloud (VPC) networking layer by using an AWS CloudFormation template.

2- Deployed an application layer by using an AWS CloudFormation template.

3- Duplicated network and application resources to another AWS Region by using AWS CloudFormation
